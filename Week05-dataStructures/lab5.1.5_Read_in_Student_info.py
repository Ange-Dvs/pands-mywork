# lab5.1.5_Read_in_Student_info.py 
# 
# Write a program that will read in the data for the data structure above, 
# ie. reads in a studentâ€™s name, then keeps reading in their modules and grades (until the user enters a blank module name),
#You can break this up into two parts:
#a. Just read in the module names until the user enters blank,
#b. Then read in the grade as well
#This program can just read in one student (and their module details)
